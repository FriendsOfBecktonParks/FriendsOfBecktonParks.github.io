Welcome  
We are the Friends of Beckton Parks (FoBP), a community-led group working to protect, enhance, and promote Beckton Parks while ensuring inclusion, diversity and equality in all its efforts.

Beckton Parks includes all the parks and green spaces of East Custom House and West Beckton within the Beckton Parks Master Plan area. These include: King George V Park and the former Newham City Farm site, New Beckton Park, Beckton Meadows, Beckton District Park South, Beckton Itchycoo Park and Pond, Beckton District Park North, along with the connecting paths and woodlands.

We aim to preserve and improve the parks for the benefit of everyone, encourage community engagement through events and activities and advocate for sustainability and accessibility by collaborating with local authorities, organisations and community groups.
